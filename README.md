# flex-ownedshops
A QB-CORE player owned shop for people, jobs or gangs

This is a quick script i made so you can add owned shops for plaeyr, gangs, jobs.

Players van add stuff to the shop and set a price.
(Shop need to be bought if it isnt from a gang or job)

You can place for each shop:
- A togle duty spot
- A place to access the shop as a buyer (Can be target or not and with a prop or not)
- A palce to manage / buy the shop

Just so you know:
This isnt fully tested with multiple people and quickly added the buy feature which us also not teste 100%.

I might push  some updates but its best to do it on yopur own if you want it to be fixed fast.

What do you need?
- SQL scrip
- qb-menu
- qb-target
