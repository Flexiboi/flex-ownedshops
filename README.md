# flex-ownedshops
A QB-CORE player owned shop for people, jobs or gangs

This is a quick script i made so you can add owned shops for plaeyr, gangs, jobs.

Players can add stuff to the shop and set a price. (Shop need to be bought if it isnt from a gang or job)

**You can place for each shop:**
- A toggle duty spot
- A place to access the shop as a buyer (Can be target or not and with a prop or not)
- A place to manage / buy the shop

||Just so you know: This isnt fully tested with multiple people and quickly added the buy feature which is also not tested 100%.||

I might push some updates but its best to do it on your own if you want it to be fixed fast.

What do you need?
- SQL scrip
- qb-menu
- qb-target

Comes translated in dutch and english
